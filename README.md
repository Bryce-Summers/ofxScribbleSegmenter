# ofxScribbleSegmenter
A segmentation procedure for planar graphs defined by an input polyline.


#Input

A list of 2D points defining a polyline.

#Output:
A list of lists of points, where each list of point represents a polygon representing one face of the planar graph when the input polyline is embedded into it.
