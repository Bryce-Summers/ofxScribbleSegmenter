I am going to optimize the intersection part of the algorithm using the

Bentley–Ottmann algorithm

I will need to get a binary search tree up and running.
I will also need to get a min Heap up an running.


Currently the code is infinitly looping is some part. It is probably generating too many intersection events.


I conjecture that the infinite looping is due to the generation of too many intersection events.

It turns out that the problem might lie somewhere in the deallocation of the Event Queue.



Expanded Mind
------------

I should stop trying to design the algorithm for the genaric case and I should design it for the scribble segmentation at hand.
